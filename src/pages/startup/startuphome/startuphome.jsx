    <h3>Step 1: Incorporate your business</h3>
    <p>First things first, you need to incorporate your business as a Private Limited Company or a Limited Liability Partnership or a Partnership firm.<br /> You just need to follow the normal procedure that includes you filling up a form to get the registration. </p>
    <h3>Step 2: Register under Startup India</h3>
    <p>Now you need to register your firm or company as a startup in the Startup India scheme of the government. <br />You just need to fill the form available for you on the Startup India website. You have to fill in all the details and upload a certain number of documents as well. </p>
    <h3>Step 3: Documents you need to upload in a PDF format only</h3>
    <p>You need a letter of recommendation along with the registration form. You can get any one of the following recommendation letters. </p>
   <ul>
   <i className='bx bxs-hand-right'></i>
   <li>A recommendation letter from an Incubator known in a post-graduate college in India, in a format approved by the DIPP. This is regarding the innovative nature of the business; OR</li>
   <i className='bx bxs-hand-right'></i>
    <li>A recommendation letter from an incubator that the Government of India funds as part of any specified scheme to promote innovation; OR</li>
    <i className='bx bxs-hand-right'></i>
    <li>A letter from any of the Incubators, recognized by the Government of India, in DIPP format. </li>
    <i className='bx bxs-hand-right'></i>
    <li>A letter of funding not less than 20% in equity, by an Incubation Fund, Private Equity Fund, Angel Fund, Accelerator, Private Equity Fund, registered with SEBI that endorses the innovative nature of business; OR</li>
    <i className='bx bxs-hand-right'></i>
    <li>A recommendation later by the Central or any State Government of India; OR</li>
    <i className='bx bxs-hand-right'></i>
    <li>A patent filed and published in the Journal of Indian Patent office in areas affiliated with the nature of the business being promoted. </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Step 4: You Need to mention if you need tax exemption</h3>
   <p>In India, startups do not have to pay income tax for the first three years but to avail such benefits, the company must be certified by the Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB). This is where companies registered with DIPP get relaxation as the registration is enough to get the benefits. </p>
   <h3>Step 5: Self-certification of the following conditions</h3>
<ul>
    <i className='bx bxs-hand-right '></i>
    <li>You are a Private limited company, an LLP or a partnership firm.</li>
    <i className='bx bxs-hand-right '></i>
    <li>Your business must be incorporated or registered in India, not before 5 years. </li>
    <i className='bx bxs-hand-right '></i>
    <li>Your companyâ€™s turnover must not be more than Rs 100 crore. </li>
    <i className='bx bxs-hand-right '></i>
    <li>The company has to keep innovating something new or making the existing system better in its own way.</li>
    <i className='bx bxs-hand-right '></i>
    <li>Your business must be a fresh idea and not a splitting up or reconstruction of an existing business. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 6: Get your recognition number</h3>
<p>On application of this registration, you will get a recognition number with immediate effect. You get the certificate of registration or incorporation only after the authority goes through all your uploaded documents.</p>
<p>You need to be careful while uploading the data, as any discrepancy in it can cause you a huge fine of up to 50% of your paid-up capital or Rs 25,000 at the very least. </p>
<p>Now that you know the eligibility and registration criteria for a startup, enrol your company as well into the Startup India scheme and reap all the benefits provided by the government.  </p>
